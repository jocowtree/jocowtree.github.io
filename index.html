Then the browser will show **the whole thing as text**, because those ``` backticks turn it into a code block in HTML.

We need to clean that.

### Fix it step by step:

1. Go to the code page:  
   👉 **https://github.com/jocowtree/jocowtree.github.io**

2. Click on **`index.html`**

3. Click the **pencil icon** (✏️) to edit.

4. **Select everything** and delete it.

5. Now paste this **clean HTML ONLY** (⚠️ do NOT include any ``` lines):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <title>My Portfolio – Decorator & Artist</title>
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello, I'm a Decorator & Artist</h1>
  <p>This is my portfolio website. Real layout coming soon!</p>
</body>
</html>
